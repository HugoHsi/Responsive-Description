		X-Acto Knife
	</h1>
	<p>
		The object is a crafting knife, by the brand "X-Acto". The knife itself is quite plain, a silver shaft that is consistent the whole way through. Near the end with the blade is a rough, grid like pattern that serves as a grip when in use. The cap for the knife is shaped to fit the knife, but as a result is quite loose and will easily fall off.
